1. Create project template by executing template.py file
2. Write the code on setup.py file to import local packages
3. Create a virtual env, activate it and install the requirements from requirements.txt
   conda create -n visa python=3.8 -y
   conda activate visa
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Do a "pip list" on terminal to make sure you have local packages installed
5. Sign up to MongoDB Atlas and create a new project by just providing it a name then next next create.
6. From "Create a deployment" screen, hit "create", Select M0 service keeping other services as default, hit "create deployment"
7. Setup the username and password and then create user.
8. Go to "network access" and add ip address - "0.0.0.0/0" so that we can access it from anywhere
9. "Connect" >> "Drivers" >> {Driver:Python, Version:3.6 or later} >> copy and save the connection string 
   with you(replace password). >> Done.
10. Create folder "notebook" >> create file "mongoDB_demo.ipynb" >> select kernal>python kernal>visa >>
11. Kaggle Data link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moro23/easyvisa-dataset
12. Push your data to mongoDB database from your python notebook.
13. Go to mongoDB Atlas >> Database >> browse collection >> see your data in key value format
14. Write the logger file and test it on demo.py
15. Write the exception file and test it on demo.py
16. EDA and Feature Engg notebook added.
17. Before we work on "Data Ingestion" component >> Declare variables within constants.__init__.py file >> 
    setup a configuration.mongo_db_connections.py file and define the func for mondodb connection >> 
    Now create a new dir "data_access", then a new file inside named usvisa_data that will use mongo_db_connections.py
    to connect with DB, fetch data in key-val format and transform that to df >>
    add code to entity.config_entity.py file till DataIngestionConfig class >>
    add code to entity.artifact_entity.py file till DataIngestionArtifact class >>
    add code to components.data_ingestion.py file >> run demo.py (set mongodb connection url first, see next step)
18. To setup the connection url on mac(also work for windows), open bash terminal and run below command:
    export MONGODB_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>...."
    To setup the connection url on Windows, open env variable setting option and add a new variable:
    Name: MONGODB_URL, Value = <url>
19. Complete the work on config.schema.yaml file (add entire info about dataset for data validation step)
20. Now work on the "Data Validation" component the way we did in step 17 for Data Ingestion. (Workflow mentioned below)
21. Now work on the "Data Transformation" component the way we did in above step. (add estimator.py to entity folder)
22. Now work on the "Model Trainer" component the way we did in above step. (add class to estimator.py in entity folder)
23. Before moving to next component of Model Evaluation, some AWS services setup is needed:
      * Login to AWS console.
      * Keep region set as - us-east-1
      * Go to IAM >> Create new user (name: usvisaproject)
      * Attach policy >> select AdministratorAccess >> next >> create user
      * Go to the user >> Security Credentials >> Access Keys >> Create access key
      * Select CLI >> agree to condition >> next >> Create Access Key >> download csv file
      * Set env variables with above csv values using below method:
      ====================================================================================
         >> Set env var from bash terminal: <<
         export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
         export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
         >> Check env var from bash terminal: <<
         echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
         echo $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

         >> Set env var from powershell terminal: <<
         $env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
         $env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
         >> Check env var from powershell terminal: <<
         echo $env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
         echo $env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      ====================================================================================
      * Now add the access key, secret key, region name to constants.__init__.py
      * Add us_visa.configuration.aws_connection.py file (To work with AWS S3 service)
      * Ensure below info in constants.__init__.py file:
            MODEL_EVALUATION_CHANGED_THRESHOLD_SCORE: float = 0.02
            MODEL_BUCKET_NAME = "usvisa-model-mlopsproj"
            MODEL_PUSHER_S3_KEY = "model-registry"
      * Go to S3 service >> Create bucket >> Region: us-east-1 >> General purpose >>
        Bucket Name: "usvisa-model-mlopsproj" >> uncheck: "Block all public access" and acknowledge >>
        Hit Create Bucket
      * Now a new dir named "cloud_storage" and files within needs to be created for the configurations
        needed to pull and push model from AWS S3 bucket. 
      * Inside "entity" dir we will have an "s3_estimator.py" file containing all the func to pull/push
        data from s3 bucket.
24. Now we will start our work on "Model Evaluation" and "Model Pusher" component.
25. Create the code structure of "Prediction Pipeline" and setup your app.py
26. Add "static" and "template" dir to the project.
27. Getting started with CI-CD process:
      * Setup the dockerfile and .dockerignore file
      * Setup the .github\workflows dir and aws.yaml file within
      * Go to AWS console and create a new IAM user exactly the way we did earlier (name: "usvisa-user") >>
        Go inside user >> Security Credentials >> Access Keys >> create access key >> CLI >> check agreement
        >> next >> create access key >> download csv
      * Now create one ECR repo to store/save docker image:
        AWS console >> Go to ECR >> Region: us-east-1 >> Hit create repository >> visibility: private >>
        repo name: usvisa >> hit create repository
      * Now create EC2 Ubuntu server >> AWS console >> EC2 >> Launch Instance >> name: usvisa-machine
        >> Image: Ubuntu >> AMI: Ubuntu Server 20.04 (free tier) >> Instance: T2 large (~chargeable-12rs/hr)
        >> create new key pair (name: usvisakey) >> allow for https and http traffic >> storage: 30gb >> Launch
        >> Go to instance >> click on "Connect" >> Connect using EC2 Instance Connect 
        >> Connect (Terminal will be launched)
28. Open EC2 and Install docker in EC2 Machine:
      ## Optinal
      sudo apt-get update -y
      sudo apt-get upgrade
      ## Required (Because Docker is'nt there in our EC2 server - [docker --version])
      curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
      sudo sh get-docker.sh
      sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
      newgrp docker
29. Next step is to connect Github with EC2(Self hosted runner):
      * select your project on Github >> go to settings >> Actions >> Runner >> New self hosted runner
        >> Select OS (Linux) >> Now step by step run all "Download" related commands on EC2 server 
        >> run first "Configure" command (hit enter instead of setting a runner group, runner name: self-hosted)
        >> enter any additional label (hit enter to skip) >> name of work folder (again hit enter)
        >> Now run second "Configure" command (./run.sh) and runner will get connected to Github
        >> To crosscheck, go back to Github and click on Runner and you will see runner state as "idle"
        >> If you do ctrl+c on EC2 server then runner will shut then restart with "./run.sh"
30. Setup your Github secrets: (Github project>Settings>SecretandVariable>Actions>NewRepoSecret)
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
      AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
      ECR_REPO
31. CI-CD pipeline will be triggered at next commit and push.
32. Now we need to activate the 8080 port of our EC2 instance:
      * Go to the instance > Security > Go to Security Groups > Edit inbound rules > add rule
        > type: Custom TCP > Port range: 8080 > 0.0.0.0/0 > Save rules
33. Now paste the public ip address on the address bar +/8080 and your app will be launched.
34. You can also do model training on /training route
